Group 2

First of all, there are a few errors in your activity diagram, namely that there
are multiple end states rather than joining the possible paths at the end with a diamond
and there are multiple diamond paths that are enclose by a single diamond path.
However, your activity diagram is understandable and these errors are inconsequential.

There are a couple of design items that need to be addressed in Iteration 2 before
we move onto the further implementation phases. The first problem is that your model
violates the Liskov Substitution Principle, for example you have Popcorn, Microwave,
and Parachute all extending the Character class and will all have an unneeded
health attribute. A solution to this would be having a superclass "Entity" that
Popcorn, Microwave, Parachute, and Character all extend.

As well, it seems as if your GUI desgin does not take into account the Android UI
library. For example "Menus" should possibly be subtypes of Activity. As well, do you
need a menu for pausing the game and ending the game? Could these be states of the
PopZombieUI rather than a seperate display? Its always important to figure in
the UI library you will be using as there will be less confusion when a 3rd party
looks at your documents.

Iteration 2 Grade: 87
