Solid work for this iteration! For the most part you've got a good start
on the UI for the game and there was a decent attempt at trying to seperate
the view from the controller for your application which is not an easy thing
to do for Android.

The code in your GameView class is quite chaotic.  You have some very large
methods with little in the way of comments.  There could definitely be some
refactoring done to it to make it a little more readable.

You're using a sort of 3D Cartesian coordinate to model the position of the
zombie.  Why is this?  It seems that polar coordinates (rotational position from
the center and distance from the center) would cover the problem quite nicely
and prevent you from having to do any conversions.

Overall, though, keep up the good work!

Total Score: 96/100
