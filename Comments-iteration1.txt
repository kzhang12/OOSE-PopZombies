Group 2

So far you guys are off to a great start on your project. There are just a few
things that need to be addressed in your previous iteration to better clarify
and round out your requirements.

The first thing that was a little confusing is how the player will move about the room.
Will the player be able to move forward and backward in the room or will the player
just be able to stand in one spot while they rotate the camera around a certain position?
Or perhaps a movement of the phone will directly move the user in the room?

As well, the Actors in your program are only the Player and the phone, everything else
is an object in your game.

Your use cases are quite insightful, however are not of the correct format. The
main path should be in an ordered list rather than in paragraph form. As well,
if there are any divergence in possible out comes you should add an alternative
to clarify what could happen. One question we did have about one of the use
cases was what happens after a zombie turns into a human?

Your domain model also needs a bit of improvement. For instance, health and ammo
could be better represented as an integer than objects in your program. Another thing
is that supply is popcorn kernels and therefore cannot be composed of popcorn. There
may be a few other things missing for instance position in the room.

Your activity diagram communicates well, however it is in the form of a flow chart
rather than an activity diagram. Finally, you might want to look into graphical
libraries for android as working with the standard android UI might be a pain.
