Your webpage directs me to the javadocs for your application rather than the homepage.

Overall great job on your game so far! You have definitely set up a decent user experience
especially with the background music. The UI does leave a bit to be desired though, the size of
the health bar, ammo, and microwave take up a rather large portion of the screen. I assume that
the size of these graphics were scaled for the tablet. These graphics should be scaled to the screen
size that it is played upon.

I also had some trouble with moving the screen from left to right, the taps would register as popcorn
rather than movement. As well, finishing one game and going back to the main menu to play another game
would cause the program to crash.

Total Score: 91/100
