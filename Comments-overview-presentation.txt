Group 2

Great job on your presentation! You all gave a great overview of your application
and clearly have a healthy app with some good extended features that could possibly
develop. As well your Q&A section went quite well.

There were however a few things that could have made the presentation even better.
First, your UML class diagram was unreadable to people in the front row let alone the
rest of the class. Ensure before any presentation that the information you're giving people
can be easily assessed by your audience. Along this line, your slides should really only be there
to augment your presentation and not be a script for it. If you're reading off your slides you
might as well have those slides as cue cards and put some other information up. Finally, a few people
were hard to hear during the presentation so make sure to speak up!
