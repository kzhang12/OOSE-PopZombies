Having a final resolution declared in your model may not be the best way to go. If
You want to be compatible to various phones running android your game should be able
to be played in mutliple resolutions.  Things like resolution are part of the UI
and should be handled there instead of in your model anyway.

One concerning thing about this iteration is that it appears as if you still have
not designed the bulk of your UI or your listeners given one of the comments in
the model is "these methods will need to be triggered by the UI using listeners
or something". This is a rather large issue that should have been addressed and/or
corrected in previous iterations.

In the model, there are some variables that you might want to initialize in the constructor
such as "totalZombiesRemainingInLevel" as you might later want to change this number possibly
for higher difficulty levels or different game modes, etc which makes your design more maliable.
